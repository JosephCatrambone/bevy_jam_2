# Bevy Jam 2: Combine!

A public repository for the second Bevy Game Jam!

## Game Ideas:
- You have a card game with two decks and two hands per player. Each time you need to play a card you have to combine two halves.
- A puzzle-ish Tetris / jigsaw cross over where you combine progressively bigger pieces.
- A game where you combine ingredients for procedurally generated recipes.
- A traditional 2D game where you can combine items.
- (Chosen) A traditional 2D game where you combine two different worlds.

## MVP for idea:
- Top-down game @ 720P
- Move and interact with WASD + jkl;.
